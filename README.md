To create a more realistic simulation, you would need to dive deep into biochemistry and implement enzyme-substrate binding, reaction kinetics, and other relevant factors. You might also consider using more advanced programming tools and libraries, such as numerical solvers or biochemical simulation packages, depending on the complexity of your project.

Additionally, consider that simulating the human body's response to digestion or exercise would require a much more comprehensive model that includes not only enzymes but also various organs, tissues, and physiological processes. Such a project would likely involve a team of experts in biology, biochemistry, and programming.
